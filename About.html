              George Clinton revolutionized funk and R&B at large as the mastermind of Parliament and Funkadelic.
              Versed in gospel, doo wop, and soul, Clinton was a singer, songwriter, bandleader, and master conceptualist.
              A hip-hop godfather, his P-Funk and solo recordings have been sampled innumerable times,
              and he has worked in the flesh with many of those whose creativity he has fueled,
              from Digital Underground and Snoop Dogg to OutKast and Kendrick Lamar.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1955, he formed the Parliaments, a vocal group based out of the back room of a barbershop where he straightened hair.
              A legal dispute with the bankrupt Revilot Records temporarily prevented the Parliaments from continuing under that name.
              Clinton renamed the group Funkadelic and seized the opportunity for a makeover, pushing the instrumentalists to the fore and embracing
              psychedelic rock without losing a grip on gospel, soul, and funk.
              Shortly thereafter, Clinton used the same lineup to launch Parliament. The group became increasingly distinct from Funkadelic,
              favoring a slicker sound enhanced by Fred Wesley's Horny Horns. By the end of the '70s, Parliament and Funkadelic had a combined 39 charting singles,
              peaking toward the end of the decade with the number one R&B hits "Flash Light," "One Nation Under a Groove," "(Not Just) Knee Deep," and
              "Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)." Seven of their albums through 1979 went either gold or platinum.
              Clinton's extended collective had also hatched groups such as U.S. (United Soul), Parlet, and the Brides of Funkenstein,
              among numerous solo projects, and repurposed a few early Clinton compositions -- "I'll Bet You" and "(I Wanna) Testify" among them -- to freakier effect.

              In 1997, Parliament-Funkadelic were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Due in part to legal entanglements, full-length Clinton projects during the 2000s and 2010s were limited to one album each from the P-Funk All-Stars and the revived Parliament and Funkadelic.
              Clinton also released an LP as a headliner, 2008's George Clinton and His Gangsters of Love. Regardless of how each release was billed, they were all truly P-Funk,
              overseen by Clinton with a mix of established and new associates.
              Clinton himself continued to collaborate with a vast assortment of artists and earned a second Grammy nomination due to his introductory role on Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly,
              which was up for Album of the Year. In 2019, the same year Clinton retired from touring, he and Parliament-Funkadelic were recipients of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy.
            </p>

              Clinton is regarded, along with James Brown and Sly Stone, as one of the foremost innovators of funk music.
              The P-Funk sound developed an influential and eclectic form of funk music during the 1970s that drew on science fiction, outlandish fashion, psychedelic culture, and surreal humor.
              Their music and influence can still be felt in music released to this day.
